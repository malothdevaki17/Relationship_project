# 💖 Relationship Compatibility Predictor

Predict relationship compatibility using survey responses with the help of machine learning.  
This project combines **unsupervised clustering** to generate labels and a **supervised Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to perform the final classification.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Relationship Compatibility Predictor** analyzes answers from a relationship-based questionnaire to predict whether two individuals would make a good match.

### 🔗 Pipeline Includes:
- 📊 Survey Data Collection via Google Forms  
- 🏷️ Label Generation using **KMeans Clustering** (Unsupervised Learning)  
- 🧠 Model Training using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** (Supervised Learning)  

This hybrid approach allows the model to:
- Discover natural clusters in respondent preferences (unsupervised),
- Learn complex patterns for accurate classification (supervised).

The final model is deployed through a **Streamlit app**, allowing users to input their answers and receive real-time compatibility predictions.

---

## 📊 1. Data Collection
- Responses gathered via a Google Form with **12 questions**.
- Questions were designed to capture preferences and personality traits.
- **149 responses** were collected and stored in CSV format.

---

## 🏷️ 2. Data Labeling
- Applied **KMeans Clustering** with `k=2` to classify responses as either:
  - ✅ "Match"
  - ❌ "No Match"
- Used clustering to avoid rule-based bias and reveal natural groupings.

---

## 🔠 3. Preprocessing
- Applied **Label Encoding** to transform categorical answers into numerical format.
- Chosen for its compactness and order preservation.

---

## 🧠 4. Model Architecture
Developed an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**:
- 2 Hidden Layers with **ReLU**
- **Dropout** + **Batch Normalization** for regularization
- **Sigmoid Output Layer** for binary classification

---

## 💾 5. Model Saving
- Trained model saved as: best_model.keras using **Keras**
- **ModelCheckpoint** used to retain the best performing weights

---

## 🧪 6. Inference with Streamlit
The app (Code_File.py) is built using **Streamlit**:
- Accepts user inputs through a form
- Uses the trained model to predict compatibility
- Displays results in real-time
